<para>This project uses extensive mathematic knowledge and advanced programming techniques to solve the world&apos;s biggest problem of all time: helping seven&apos;s grade students to solve linear and quadratic equations.</para>

<para>This project may look extremely complex, but it actually is. So, to help our fellow 7 graders understand all depths of programming, linear algebra and quantum mechanics this documentation was created. </para>
