This project uses extensive mathematic knowledge and advanced programming techniques to solve the world\textquotesingle{}s biggest problem of all time\+: helping seven\textquotesingle{}s grade students to solve linear and quadratic equations.

This project may look extremely complex, but it actually is. So, to help our fellow 7 graders understand all depths of programming, linear algebra and quantum mechanics this documentation was created.
